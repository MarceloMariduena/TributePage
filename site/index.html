                <li>He designed the programming of the world's first commercial computer - Whilst at the University of Manchester, Alan designed the programming system of the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available electronic digital computer.</li>
                <li>He is the father of ArtificiaI Intelligence - Alan Turing is generally regarded as the pioneer of Artificial Intelligence. He believed that computers would be able to learn and devised the Turing Test, which would text whether a computer was really intelligent. No computer has passed the test, as yet.</li>
                <li>Alan was awarded an OBE for his wartime services - He was awarded the OBE in 1945 for services to the country in wartime, despite the fact that most of what he did would not be made public for another 30 years.</li>
                <li>He was the inventor of the Turing Machine - In 1935, Alan Turing invented a device which is now referred to as the Turing Machine. To this day, all stored-programme digital computers are modelled on this invention.</li>
                <li>He was integral to the building of The Bombe. - Although Polish scientists had previously invented a device known as a 'Bomba', Alan took their early versions and developed it into an electro-mechanical machine which greatly helped in the breaking of the Enigma code used by the German forces.</li>
                <li>His work enabled the Enigma to be decoded - By early 1942, the team at Bletchley Park were decoding up to 39,000 Enigma messages a month. Eventually this number rose to 84,000 or about two messages decoded every minute.</li>
                <li>Alan Turing's war work is believed to have shortened the war - Many people, including Winston Churchill, claimed that Alan Turing's work shortened the Second World War by at least two years.</li>
                <li>Alan was a member of the team which decoded the 'Fish' cipher - The 'Fish' cipher which was used towards the end of the war by the German High Command to transmit messages between Hitler and senior officers in the field.</li>
